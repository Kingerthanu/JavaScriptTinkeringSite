# JavaScriptTinkeringSite
Some Small Nav Site with seperate pages all running a sense of javascript.

Definently scrappy around the edges, but is acknowledged and understood why (I.E. Template management).

**The Breakdown:**

  This Program Works With .html Files In Order To Created A Linked Website. 

  When Opened In The Home Menu You Have The Ability To Move Over Through The Bootstrap Fixed Toolbar To Migrate To Other Pages. We Also Have The Search Feature Integrated With A General Query That Currently Doesn't Call Any Local Or External Database.

  One Of Our Site Pages Works With MapBox To Call Its Map API To Allow The User To Have A Session With Its Features Through Our Own Website. This Works By Using A Admin Session Key In Which Allows The Website To Call A API Request Under The Admins Account. While Not That Surmountable In Usage, Still Allowed Me To Learn A Lot About The Way Libraries Can Be Shared Over The Website In Secure, Tabbed Manner. 

  Another Page Is Zombie Infestation In Which Works In JavaScript To Create A Enemy Zombie Class With A Associated Sprite Texture In Which To Represent It On The Webpage. The User Has The Ability To Click On The Zombies To Kill Them, Increasing Their Score. 

  Painting Is Another Page In Which Allows The User To Dynamically Draw/Update Our HTML Code Using The Cursor On A Canvas With JavaScript. This Page Has A Little More Features Than The Others, Allowing The User To Click Buttons In Order To Change The Color Of Their Drawing As Well As Erase Parts.

  Finally There Is The Rainbow Wall Page In Which Updates Our HTML Code Dynamically From Our Users Input By Allowing Them To Pick A Direction In Which For Our Rainbow Color To Move And Fill In. It Also Allows The User The Ability To Freeze The Motion Mid-Fill. 

  This Mainly Was Done To Help Me Learn About Bootstrap More As Well As API Transactions. It Also Taught Me A Good Amount About JavaScript and How To Handle A Multi-Paradigm, Dynamic Language.

  Using a API transaction with Mapbox I was allowed to implement it into my own website for usage.

**Zombie Infestation!:**

  Using pngs and hitbox detection with the cursor I made a little game where the zombies spawn in randomly on the page for you to click away.

  Using a palette board on the top left of the screen click on a color and then click on the canvas to start drawing and click again to stop. You can also clear the canvas if it gets too messy.
