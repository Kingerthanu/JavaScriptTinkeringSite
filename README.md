# JavaScriptTinkeringSite
Some Small Nav Site with seperate pages all running a sense of javascript.

Definently scrappy around the edges, but is acknowledged and understood why (I.E. Template management).

This program helped me learn about bootstrap and API transactions. It also taught me a good amount about javascript and how to handle a dynamic language.

API Mapbox Map:

  Using a API transaction with Mapbox I was allowed to implement it into my own website for usage.

Zombie Infestation!:

  Using pngs and hitbox detection with the cursor I made a little game where the zombies spawn in randomly on the page for you to click away.
